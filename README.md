# Amazon-clone
I developed a home page clone of Amazon using pure/custom CSS without any external CSS frameworks or libraries. The project focuses on replicating the core layout and design elements of the Amazon home page, showcasing:

## üåê Live Demo

üëâ [Visit Live Site](https://amazon-clone-d5bt.onrender.com)

Header: Includes logo, search bar, and navigation links similar to Amazon's top navigation.

Responsive Navigation Menu: Custom styled links for categories and account options.

Product Sections: Multiple product display sections arranged with grids or flexbox for neat alignment.

Promotional Banners: Custom-styled banners/carousels to highlight deals or offers.

Footer: Mimics the Amazon footer with multiple informational links.

The main goal was to practice CSS layout techniques (flexbox, grid, positioning), typography, color schemes, and responsive design principles by recreating a popular real-world website's look and feel purely with CSS.
